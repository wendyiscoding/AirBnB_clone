# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

Now that we have a command interpreter for managing our AirBnB objects, it's time to make them alive! Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step. During this project, we will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages.

## Goals

* Learn HTML/CSS

* Create the HTML of your application

* Create template of each object

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

* All your files should end with a new line

* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

* Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator

* All your CSS files should be in `styles` folder

* All your images should be in `images` folder

* You are not allowed to use `!important` and `id` (`#...` in the CSS file)

* You are not allowed to use tags `img`, `embed` and `iframe`

* You are not allowed to use Javascript

* Current screenshots have been done on `Chrome 56` or more.

* No cross browsers

* You have to follow all requirements but some `margin`/`padding` are missing - you should try to fit as much as you can to screenshots
