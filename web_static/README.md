# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

Now that we have a command interpreter for managing our AirBnB objects, it's time to make them alive! Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step. During this project, we will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages.
